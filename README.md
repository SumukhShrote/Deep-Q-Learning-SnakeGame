# Deep-Q-Learning-SnakeGame  

### Abstract  
This project presents a Deep Q-Learning-based autonomous agent capable of playing the classic Snake game. A custom neural network architecture was implemented, comprising an 11-input layer, two hidden layers with 256 neurons each, and a 3-output layer representing possible actions. A reward system was designed to encourage fruit consumption and penalize collisions with the edges or the tail, driving optimal decision-making. Training results demonstrated the agent's ability to autonomously navigate and play the game proficiently, achieving notable performance by episodes 120â€“130.  

### Instructions  
- Run `agent.py` to train the model.
